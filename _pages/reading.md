I think reading lists by people that do stuff I find interesting is a useful way to discover relevant new books for yourself. I've made use of reading lists such as the one by <u>Bill Gates</u> and been inspired by the idea of sharing them with a personal comment attached (like Oliver Eidel does <u>here</u>). I'll do the same here by sharing non-fiction books I've read including my personal note on each:
