I think reading lists by people that do stuff I find interesting is a useful way to discover relevant new books for yourself.

<u>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</u>

One of the most life-changing books I've read. Since reading that book I became an organization/structure maniac, but in a good way. It's how you survive in complex environments like the one when you found a company.

The examples to the principles are a bit old-fashioned and should be brought into the digital world. But apart from that: recommend this book!

I've even wrote an article about stuff I've learned from this book: [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/achieve-stress-free-productivity-implementing-working-malte-bucksch/)

<u>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</u>

Really interesting read on persuasian and sales tactics that people use! I don't really like to use manipulative sales tactics but the book prepares for people using those tactics against you.

<u>Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works (Lean Series)</u>

... TODO

<u>Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth</u>

Great book about marketing channels. I've used their framework of 19 distribution channels all the time in my projects/ventures. It helps a lot to simply your decisions. Read this book and "Positioning" (see below) and you understood some really important parts of effective marketing.

<u>Head First Design Patterns</u>

Reading a book about Design Patterns is a must for any ambitous software developer. This book is an excellent, entertaining introduction.

<u>ReWork: Change the Way You Work Forever</u>

I admire David Hansson and Jaso Fried for having an ability to constantly come up with unpopular opinions that mostly really make sense. They think shit through on their own without relying on other people's beliefs. That leads to some smart conclusions and new approaches to make business. Some of those opinions, they summarize in this book. Also a short read.

<u>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</u>

Great book about the fundamental principles of Marketing. Understanding positioning is key to developing effective marketing strategies.

<u>The Fortune Cookie Principle: The 20 keys to a great brand story and why your business needs one</u>

... TODO

<u>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</u>

Great book, and a really entertaining read. Finished it without any feeling of effort. Great inspiration to take bold risks in your life.  

<u>The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers</u>

Simply a really, really awesome book about company culture and e.g. the difference between war time and peace time in companies. Also very reflected content - **no** silver bullet promised, **no** radical black & white thinking. Great.

<u>Speed Reading: Learn to Read a 200+ Page Book in 1 Hour</u>

Cannot really recommend it. I don't consider the skill of speed reading a very important skill. A non-fiction book needs lots of thinking and lots of action if you really wanna get sth out of it. So speed-reading is close to lying to yourself and a certain type of laziness to actually process the content. Speed reading could be helpful to skim certain passages but it does not deliver the breakthrough it promises imo.

<u>The Elements of Style</u>

I don't really get 100% why this is book is so famous. It's basically a guide to English grammar. That is great but I hoped for a little more after every person on the internet recommended it to me. 

I like the core statement that you should be brief in your writing. Every single word should have value or otherwise be eliminated.

BUT I think the suggestions to have the perfect grammar and the perfect set of words does not apply completly if you e.g. write blog posts that are meant to teach complicated stuff. In that case, grammar and style are less important than having a really thought-through structure in your text that explains the complicated stuff in simple human language. You can even have shitty grammar or spelling mistakes. If the explanation allows the reader to understand a complicated topic, you did a great job. Instead of overoptimising the language I'd focus on the logical structure of your explanations. 80:20-rule - language is not always critical in all forms of writing. Maybe read the "lean startup" to kill that perfectionist in yourself that this book might create.

<u>How to Win Friends & Influence People</u>

Really loved that book! Some great guidelines that help to understand that social side of the human mind a bit better.

Sometimes, I feel like the recommendations are a bit too focused on "pleasing other people". Dale somehow recommends to not contradict other people's opinions. That might be true in formal settings where you simply want to make a good first impression. However, in other circumstances: contradicting other people's opinions is important to make the world progress. Bad ideas need to die, great ideas need to spread. Also, oftentimes you learn a lot yourself by disapproving with somebody's point of view. You allow another person to explain their point with more details that way and might uncover that either you or the other person was wrong.

And, of course, all of the rules have tons of exceptions. If you dumbly apply everything in the book, you probably just act like a creep. Everything depends on context. 

## 2015

<u>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment</u>

Great book that changed my life (I know, it sounds cheesy). It was my first touch point with the philosophy behind meditation. Knowing and applying that "Be in the moment"-philosophy was really helpful for my wellbeing.

As many great authors who's life focuses on one topic mostly, the book does sometimes feel a bit radical. He tries to explain every single part of the world with one single philosophy which is not feasible imo. 

I e.g. don't think everything bad in the world is ONLY because people are "not in the moment". Nor I consider it to be practical to "always be in the moment". Knowing the mantra is great but planning for the future and reviewing the past is important. There is nothing wrong with that in my opinion. Most people (including me) are just a bit out of balance and focus too much on future and past. 

<u>The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses</u>

A classic among people in the area of entrepreneurship. And rightfully so! The insights are absolutely game changing if you havn't read a similar book about entrepreneurship before. 

Don't build something you havn't tested in an experiment. Avoid Waste. Verify your assumptions with tests. Fail fast. 
Lots of interesting opinions on how to increase your chances of building a successful startup.

Some of the principles don't exactly seem to work for B2B-startups where there is usually a only tiny amount of data at the beginning. For B2B, you often have 10 conversions worth 100k dollars each and have a profitable business. That's not enough data points though to test hypotheses for conversions. Much better data if you sell 10k shoes for 100 dollars each (B2C).

<u>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</u>

A really interesting read that I highly recommend. The psychological findings and background explanations are fascinating. To be honest, I don't know if the book really changed anything about my habits. At least, the suggested habit changing framework didn't seem to click for me. Still, the information probably had some indirect impact on me. E.g. to know that bad habits can hardly be eliminated - they need to be **replaced**. This is somehing that feels very accurate and matches my experience so far.

<u>The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play</u>

Really fun book! It won't change your life but it still helps me to remember number-based pins/passwords until this day.

<u>Launch: An Internet Millionaire's Secret Formula To Sell Almost Anything Online, Build A Business You Love, And Live The Life Of Your Dreams</u>
