We founded QuickBird in 2016 with the goal to become an app agency focussing on building truely great apps instead of the mediocre stuff that other agencies often seemed to produce. 

That continues to be our motto until today and is also part of the reason why we are heavily foccussing heavily on the medical industry. There is a natural demand for quality in this space. To build safety-critical software that patients rely on, you need to take software quality seriously. Our customers in this space know this and appreciate our focus on quality.

Since 2016, we grew from 4 people to 22 people (as of 2022):





# What is QuickBird?

In a nutshell, we are a software agency. We have two departments:

#### QuickBird Medical

We focus on building medical software for companies in the health space. We, therefore, know how to develop software as a medical device in compliance with the regulatory requirements that apply.
