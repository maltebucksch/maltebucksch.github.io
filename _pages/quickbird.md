We founded QuickBird in 2016 with the goal to become an app agency focussing on building truely great apps instead of the mediocre stuff that other companies often seemed to produce.

That continues to be our motto until today and is also part of the reason why we are foccussing heavily on the medical industry. There is a natural demand for quality in this space. To build safety-critical software that patients can rely on, you need to take software quality seriously. 

Since the founding in 2016, we grew a team of 25 awesome developers, project managers, quality assurance specialists and marketers (as of 2022).
