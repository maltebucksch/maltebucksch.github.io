## QuickBird (2016 - now)

This is the company and team that all of my life blood flows into. We are a team of 25 people building apps (in an agency model) with a focus on the medical industry.

## SoundSnip (2014 - 2018)

SoundSnip was the first product I built that I've also founded a company for. It was a more serious endevour than my previous hobby projects. I've founded it together with Thomas during my studies.
