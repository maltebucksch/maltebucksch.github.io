I've always wanted to "have my own thing". Building stuff, programming software, writing articles, coming up with creative concepts - that kind of stuff all felt really fun to me. So building up a successful company seemed like a really cool life goal. So far, I have founded two companies: [SoundSnip](/project/venture-01-soundsnip) & [QuickBird](/quickbird)

## QuickBird (2016 - now)

This is the company & team that all of my life blood flows into for the last years and many, many more years to come. Building software for the medical industry just feels like the coolest thing to do for me right now. It's an awesome venture, with an awesome co-founder, an awesome team and some awesome products. I could not be more thankful to have it.

## SoundSnip (2015 - 2018)

SoundSnip was my first company ever and taught me so many valueable things about entrepreneurship. I've founded it together with Thomas during my studies. Since many student-startups tend to fail even before product development kick-off, what I am especially proud of: We were a startup with a working product **on the market** and **paying** customers (we didn't earn a lot but people payed for the value they received).
