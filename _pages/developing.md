Ever since I can imagine I've enjoyed developing software.
The combination of logical and creative thinking is just tons of fun.
Here, you can can find some of the software pieces I've developed:

## App Development Projects

These are some of the mobile apps I've developed so far: [See App Projects](/projects-apps)

## Game Development Projects

When I was a teenager, I was really into game development.
These are some of the games that I've implemented.
They are not the most pretty, which is because I "designed" them all by myself using Microsoft Paint :D
I've even composed the music for these games on my own sometimes (which was a really bad idea).
