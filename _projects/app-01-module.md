Studieren.de was our first (!) customer for <a href="/QuickBird">QuickBird</a> after we founded the company in 2016 and this was my first project for them. At that time, I was still actively programming Android apps as part of the team.

Valentin, the managing director, offered us his office during that time. I am still thankful for that. So, this project also gave us our first place to work.
