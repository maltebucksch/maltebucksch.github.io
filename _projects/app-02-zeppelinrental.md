Zeppelin was our second customer for [QuickBird](/QuickBird). We built a new version of the existing mobile apps for Zeppelin Rental, a platform for renting construction vehicles and equipment. 

While we were programming the app, we often stayed at Zeppelin's office to make collaboration easier. We got unlimited free food for lunch every day - I still have that part very vividly in my head 😍🌮. 

# About the project

Zeppelin Rental is an online shop with customized machinery for construction works and events. Renting instead of buying allows companies to stay flexible and reduce their financial risk. The Zeppelin Rental app brings construction and event products right to the users’ phone in an easy, efficient Amazon-like marketplace.
