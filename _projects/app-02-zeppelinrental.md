Zeppelin was our second customer for QuickBird. We built a new version of their existing mobile apps for them. While I was programming the app, we were often staying at Zeppelin's office to make collaboration between our teams officer. We got unlimited free food for lunch every day which is still the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about the project.

# About the project

Zeppelin Rental is an online shop with customized machinery for construction works and events. Renting instead of buying allows companies to stay flexible and reduce their financial risk. The Zeppelin Rental app brings construction and event products right to the usersâ€™ phone in an easy, efficient Amazon-like marketplace.
