SoundSnip was one of the coolest things I've developed so far. I started developing the app while I was in China (2014) to make it easier to learn Mandarin. I wanted to be able to capture what Chinese people said to me if I didn't understand it in order to look it up. That gave way to an idea that could be used in many other scenarios as well, other than language learning.

I started programming right when the first Android Wear smartwatch came out. Therefore, it was one of the very first Android Wear Smartwatch apps on the market. It was a fun and extremely frustrating experience at the same time. I spent months and months inside coffee shops in Shanghai to develop the app.

When it was finished in its first version and went back to Munich I met up with Thomas, a young, ambitius marketing expert. Together, we wanted to make SoundSnip popular. We founded a company (mostly to have some legal protection - we didn't really plan to become the next "facebook" with this idea). Thomas managed to get us into UnternehmerTUM who supported our startup by providing mentors and workshops.

SoundSnip was the first app that allows you to rewind time. It helped musicians to capture melodies that they would have otherwise lost. Mothers can listen to the (first) words of their child again. Pupils used it to capture "Did you really just say that?!"-moments.

After two super exciting (often also exhausting) years, we decided to stop the project. We didn't see any good way to turn it into a profitable business (we earned money but not nearly enough to make up even for our own time investment). Thomas got a really great job offer and I wanted to focus on QuickBird which I had founded shortly after SoundSnip together with Stefan.

We grew a user base of more than 2000 people, got covered multiple times by the media, won awards and, most importantly, learned a LOT.

# What does the app exactly do?

SoundSnip gets you back the most important moments in your life. After they happened.

With the App you can capture the last minute of what just happened. Whenever you want to. Say, you run into a moment that you would like to remember. Just quickly tap your phone or smart-watch and the last minute of audio gets saved permanently.
