Over the years I developed, refined and published the Frekl Game Engine. It is used in a number of different games like **Dabuda**, **Spellcreator**, **ZeroDependent** and **The Road to Ruin**. The ZFX Game developer community was a great support there to improve it over the years. Since I switched to other projects some years ago, I needed to stop development of it. Right now, it is no longer safe to be used. It is especially designed for programmers who want to create 2D games in a minimum amount of time with Java.

Some of its functions and features include:

- Efficient rendering engine with double buffering
- Camera-perspective tracking
- Clipping algorithm for large game worlds
- Animation-Engine
- Rotation of Sprites and other complex shapes
- Collision detection and avoidance
- Basic Enemy-AI Classes
- System for custom weapons (can be tried in the [Spelleditor](/project/game-03-spelleditor))
- Convenience i/o functions for serialization of big amounts of data
- Offline Highscore and Online Highscore Management
